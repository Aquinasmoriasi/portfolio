        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-light">
        I am a freelance software developer and a student at Microverse, a fully
        remote software development school. In just 7 months, I have been able
        to successfully switch careers from being an analytical chemist to
        becoming a full-stack developer. I achieved this by going back to the
        basics of learning and being equipped to learn any language, tool or
        framework that I come across in the tech world. As a developer, I build
        projects using languages such as Javascript and Ruby and also frameworks
        such as React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails, among other technologies. My
        experience at Microverse includes weekly engagement in pair programming
        and peer-to-peer review, which helps me get the feel of a real-life
        software developerâ€™s experience.
